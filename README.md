Particle System

Physics-based procedural animation of particles and to practice using OpenGL's instanced rendering system.

**Features:** 
- Physics Based Particles: particles move using euler integration.
- Procedural Shape and Coloring: in honor of an eventual pride month, the particles go through all the colors of the rainbow in a cycle over time. The particles are heart shaped to represent love :)
- Interactive Forces: particles move towards point at right click and away at left click. Note: when the particles are repelled from a point, in order to not leave bounds of the sphere after release, they come rushing back in!
- Mesh Surface Attraction: the particles move towards specified meshes!
